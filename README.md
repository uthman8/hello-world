# hello-world

My name is ousman samusa i'm from the Gambia but i currently live in spain at the moment, i'm 20 years old i started studying web developing in the Gambia but to due to lack of proper resources (internet and computers) and motivation i wasn't able to fully concentrate, now that i'm in a place where those stuffs are available and with the motivation of a friend i'm willing to give everything to learn coding.
